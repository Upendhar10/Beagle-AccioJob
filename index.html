      <h2>The Beagle Blog</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Beagle</strong> is a breed of small scent hound, similar in
        appearance to the much larger foxhound. The <strong>beagle</strong> was
        developed primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling. Possessing a
        great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, the
        <strong>beagle</strong> is the primary breed used as a detection dog for
        prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the
        world. The <strong>beagle</strong> is intelligent and is a popular pet
        due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.
